1. Get skin cancer HAM10000 dataset from: ('https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000')
2. Sort the dataset using the given metadata(HAM10000_metadata) file.
3. To do so, use the sort.ipynb file. Create directories: akiec, bcc, bkl, df, mel, nv, vasc in the same 
   directory as the project.
   ----> Go through the code to understand how the sorting takes place.
4. Once sorted, run the main.ipynb file to process the images and turn them into corresponding pickle files.
5. CNN.ipynd contains the CNN model.
6. Now use the CNN.ipynd to train the model or makes changes to the model accordingly.
7. The code is explained in detail. 

---XXXX---NOTE:Since all the files are in the ipynd format, I highly recommend using JUPYTER NOTEBOOK---XXXX---
 
Have fun, understand and play around with and tune the model to achieve better accuracy and results ;)
